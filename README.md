# Prior Flow: A global analysis technique using copulas to model Bayesian priors

Based on "*A global analysis strategy to resolve neutrino NSI degeneracies with scattering and oscillation data*" by Dutta, Lang, Liao, Sinha, Strigari, Thompson. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03066). This repository is meant to provide pedagogical material to supplement the paper.

Here I will provide a simple, canned example as well as a simplified fragment of the real analysis done in 2002.03066.
